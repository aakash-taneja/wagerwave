# **WagerWave** - On-Chain Betting Application

![alt text](wagerwave.png)

## Overview

**WagerWave** is a decentralized on-chain betting application designed for the oraichain. Utilizing CosmWasm smart contracts written in Rust and deployed on the Oraichain network, WagerWave ensures a secure, transparent, and decentralized platform for users to place bets on a variety of events.

## Project Description

The aim is to create an end-to-end application that contains the following components:

- **User onboarding**: Users register on the platform using their Keplr wallet.
- **Bet Creation**: Authorized entities can create betting events with specific parameters.
- **Placing Bets**: Users can place bets on their chosen outcome by sending tokens to the smart contract.
- **Event Resolution**: Once the event concludes, the outcome is verified, and the smart contract automatically distributes the winnings to the correct users.
- **Payouts**: Winnings are transferred directly to the usersâ€™ wallets.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js for building a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **Backend**: Rust and CosmWasm for developing secure and efficient smart contracts.
- **Blockchain**: Oraichain for deploying and managing smart contracts.
- **Wallet Integration**: Keplr wallet for user authentication and transaction management.
